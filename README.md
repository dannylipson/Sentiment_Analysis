# Sentiment_Analysis

Sentiment Analysis as a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP)  allows us to determine algorithmically whether a statement or document is “positive” or “negative”.

Sentiment analysis is a technology of increasing importance in the modern society as it allows individuals and organizations to detect trends in public opinion by analyzing social media content. Keeping abreast of socio-political developments is especially important during periods of policy shifts such as election years, when both electoral candidates and companies can benefit from sentiment analysis by making appropriate changes to their campaigning and business strategies respectively.

The purpose of this project is to compute the sentiment of text information - in our case, tweets posted recently on Canadian Elections - and answer the research question: “What can public opinion on Twitter tell us about the Canadian political landscape in 2021?” The goal is to essentially use sentiment analysis on Twitter data to get insight into the Canadian Elections. For this project, pulled tweets regarding the Canadian elections from the announcement of the 2021 election to the day before the election was used for analysis.
